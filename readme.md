# 🐍 Python Portfolio – Hayes Gunther

Welcome to my Python Portfolio! This repository highlights a collection of projects completed in my Python programming course. Each section demonstrates core Python concepts such as data types, control structures, functions, file I/O, and more advanced topics like object-oriented programming and exception handling.
